## Welcome to Engineer for Beer

So what in the actual heck is Engineer for Beer?

The answer is simple. This is a community for infrastructure engineers to collaborate and do cool stuff!


### Why do you need this

If you don't already know, then its likely you wouldn't understand. 

The problem statement is simple, there is no good place to get stuff that actually works. Engineer for Beer is a simple place with simple goals. We take all the hard stuff, work it all out for you, and then post it on the interwebs for you to download. 

### Why is your site so poorly written

It's because we don't really care about websites, we are about infrastructre as code. 

Most of the cool stuff is in our github repo [Eng4Beer Github](https://github.com/eng4beer)

### Is everything going to be so cynical

Yes

### When is there going to be something on here that is actually useful. 

When we get around to it.
